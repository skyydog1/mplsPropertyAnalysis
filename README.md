# Minneapolis Rent Analysis

This project aims to look at Minneapolis property data (2020 + 2022) to determine what factors drive prices in Minneapolis, and practice visualizing information using Python, and increase access of information to property values.

This will be geared towards property analysis, for real estate agents and for those analyzing the Minneapolis housing market.

# What I aim to have done by the end of the project

### Descriptive Stats by Ward
1. Mean, median, std dev (ln value and original)
2. Count of total properties listed
3. total value of building, land value, and total value
4. Quartiles and IQR for variability

### Price per Square Analysis
1. Normalized land, building, total value by square footage
2. Find undervalued or undervalued

### Correlation Matrix
1. (Ln and original) bedrooms, bathrooms, date built, distance from downtown

### Ward Boxplots :house:
1. Use sns.boxplots to compare distribution of value between wards.

### Determine how rent has changed for each property and for each ward since 2022.
1. Create tables using Pandas and numpy.

### Interactive map by ward
1. Maybe create an app using react and sql to interact with data, if too ambitious, use jupyter noteboook
