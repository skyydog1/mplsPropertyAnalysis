# Minneapolis Property Analysis :house:

### The Driving Question
What is the current status of the Minneapolis property market? What factors drive prices in Minneapolis? 


The goal of this project practice visualizing information using Python, data analysis, and creating something.

# What I aim to have done by the end of the project :heavy_check_mark:

### Descriptive Stats by Ward :chart:
1. Mean, median, std dev (ln value and original)
2. Count of total properties listed
3. total value of building, land value, and total value
4. Quartiles and IQR for variability
5. Linear regression
6. Anova

### Price per Square Analysis :office:
1. Normalized land, building, total value by square footage
2. Find undervalued or undervalued

### Correlation Matrix
1. (Ln and original) bedrooms, bathrooms, date built, distance from downtown

### Ward Boxplots :house:
1. Use sns.boxplots to compare distribution of value between wards.

### Determine how rent has changed for each property and for each ward since 2022.
1. Create tables using Pandas and numpy.

### Interactive map by ward
1. Maybe create an app using react and sql to interact with data, if too ambitious, use jupyter noteboook
